For an evaluation assignment at BeCode we needed to come up with a fictional business and create a functional website for them, we came up with a company that fits in perfectly in some kind of cyberpunk dystopia. FRSH sells 'clean' air vapes at exuberant prices.

It's also our first group project technically, so we needed to create one repo and work on it together. Github allows us to publish the page and have everyone else view it.
